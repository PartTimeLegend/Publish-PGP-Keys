Antony Bailey Public PGP Keys
=============================

What is PGP?
-----------

>"Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a data encryption and decryption computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication.
>PGP is often used for signing, encrypting and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories and whole disk partitions to increase the 
security of e-mail communications. 
>It was created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.
PGP and similar products follow the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880 ) for encrypting and decrypting data." -- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)

Why would I need them?
---------------------

If you wish to contact me and encrypt the data being transmitted you can use my public key. This means that only I can read the contents of your communication.

How do I use this public key?
-----------------------------

You should download a Keyring application. Some examples of which are:

* [GnuPG](http://www.gnupg.org)
* [Gpg4win](http://www.gpg4win.org)

It is personal preference. Please ensure you are using a secure application that has been peer reviewed. I would recommend you look for a program with open source code so you can build yourself to ensure that you have a clean install.

Can you gaurantee my communication is secure?
---------------------------------------------

No. I take all precautions to ensure that my own data and devices are without fault. I cannot and **will** not be held responsible for any issues arrising from security implications.
