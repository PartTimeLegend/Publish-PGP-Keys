I am a full time software developer for a multinational organisation. I code in my spare time and to extend the use of software that has purpose. I try to use free software wherever possible, and I like to contribute where possible.

I have been writing Open Source for at least 15 years. I just want to help the world and not cost the earth.

## What do you use Donations for?

This is a great question. I use the donations I receive to buy a wide range of things from Energy Drinks to computer hardware. I also donate a large portion of it to other projects that I support including the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

## Why sould I donate?

If you find value in what I do then, please feel free to donate to me. I'm not going to force you to donate, you can use my software completely free of charge and without limitation for any purpose you want. If you really want to give something to me then you are welcome to do so. I don't expect donations, nor do I insist that you give them.

## Okay, how can I donate?

I accept donations in several ways. I may add more over time if they seem to be of use to me.

## I want to donate in another way.

Thank you for this. I don't currently have other ways to receive donations. Though feel free to get in contact with me and I will be happy to discuss further.

## Is my donation secure?

I make every effort possible to keep both yours and my information secure. If you pay with one of the coin options, you don't even need to tell me who you are. The only one of the donation methods that requires any personally identifiable information is PayPal. I only accept them as everyone has an account, though they are not my favourite company to deal with.

The coin options are all linked to paper wallets, which have been generated offline and are held in a secure location. I do not have physical access to these at all times. They are stored away from my home or office.

## Will I get custom support if I donate?

No more than anyone else. If you need help, get in touch.

## I have read this entire thing and I still don't want to donate.

Good for you. Spend your money on something you want. I'm just having fun.

## Will you write custom software for donations?

No. I will write custom software for you for a cost. You might want to look at my [IT Consultancy Service](http://www.antonybailey.net).

## I donated and you haven't moved the coins. Have you lost them?

Not at all. I will only redeem my coins should the need arise. I will happily let them sit for the rainy day that people talk about.</pre></body><style id="igor_ext_nofollow">a[rel~='nofollow']{outline:.14em dotted red !important;outline-offset:.2em;}a[rel~='nofollow'] > img{outline:thin dotted red !important;outline-offset:.2em;}</style></html>
